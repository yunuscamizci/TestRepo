## Night Crawler

Night Crawler is an horde survival game which sets on a dark planet with no stars are visible, and the only light source is a magical generator with an  endless hunger. The main character is a fire-born homunculi who controls bodies those long-death miners piled up before the generator, and our only goal is to save generator against night creatures of this dark planet no matter what! Scared of death? No problem, death is only a resource here, the safety of the generator has the utmost importance. When generator is destroyed, the game ends.

Night Crawler has several characters to be reckoned with, first of all is night creatures, the dark elements of the hostile planet. These creatures are born from darkness and aims to destroy any light source which disturbs the planet and they come in various forms: tanks, warriors, mages, archers... and they all has different weaknesses and strong sides. Then we have the generator, which is re-animates us after death and our strongest ally against the dark creatures. It illuminates the place for our seek and dissipates heat which harms the creatures of the night. To heal the generator, one must feed it with fuel. Last but not least, we have our beheaded character which hosts the holy fire of the generator. Beheaded homunculi holds a weapon that fires light with two hand and has a pickaxe in his backpack. When he needs the pickaxe, he can change these objects place and can carry only one pickaxe and only one weapon at a time. With the pickaxe, the ground can be mined to uncover several precious fuels.

Night Crawler has features that are rather interesting: Fighting, Mining and Surviving! To make the character stronger, one must collect the drops from night creatures which levels up the player and upgrades several features like: max health, damage, mining speed, health regeneration... Generator is also up-gradable by fuels that come in several rarity: Coal, Tar, Oil and even Thorium can be used as a fuel by the generator! If generator has loss health, these fuels firstly regens the generator, then generator can be leveled up to upgrade several features: range of illumination, heat dissipation, heating range, max health, efficient fuel consumption...
